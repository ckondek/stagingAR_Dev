# stagingAR_Dev

- New branches should be created from and merged into the development branch only and never directly from/into the main branch.
- New branches should always be created for only one specific task/feature, so that they can be merged and closed after that feature is finished.
- Branches should be named in a way that makes it very obvious which feature is being implemented (e.g. "astrid-shoppingcart-scene").

These rules are helpful to maintain a good overview of what was implemented and merging will help keep everyone up to date with everybody else's work.
